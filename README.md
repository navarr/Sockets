Sockets is a PHP Library intent on making working with PHP Sockets easier, including the creation and management of a Socket Server.

## Work in Progress

The code is currently still a work in progress, with the Socket class itself not yet fully complete.  There is a lot I still need to understand about how sockets work both in PHP and probably in C in order to make everything work amazingly.

Not everything is tested yet, and not everything works properly yet.

It is advised not to seriously use this until I create git tag 1.0.0.  There will be breaking changes before then.

## Usage of SocketServer

Using SocketServer is supposed to be an easy and trivial task (and the class should be documented enough to understand what it's doing without me).

### Example of an ECHO Server

```php
<?php

use Navarr\Socket\Socket;
use Navarr\Socket\Server;

class EchoServer extends Server
{
    const DEFAULT_PORT = 7;

    public function __construct($ip = null, $port = self::DEFAULT_PORT)
    {
        parent::__construct($ip, $port);
        $this->addHook(Server::HOOK_CONNECT, array($this, 'onConnect'));
        $this->addHook(Server::HOOK_INPUT, array($this, 'onInput'));
        $this->addHook(Server::HOOK_DISCONNECT, array($this, 'onDisconnect'));
        $this->run();
    }

    public function onConnect(Server $server, Socket $client, $message)
    {
        echo 'Connection Established',"\n";
    }

    public function onInput(Server $server, Socket $client, $message)
    {
        echo 'Received "',$message,'"',"\n";
        $client->write($message, strlen($message));
    }

    public function onDisconnect(Server $server, Socket $client, $message)
    {
        echo 'Disconnection',"\n";
    }
}

$server = new EchoServer('0.0.0.0');

```
